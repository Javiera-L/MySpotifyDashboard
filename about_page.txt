<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  I've long been curious about making the most of Spotify's data, which gives insights into tracks, from their tempo to energy. My goal was to create a web app for music lovers and musician friends to explore artists and their work.
</p>

<h2>Features and Uses</h2>
<p>
  This resource is a platform to explore Spotify features like valence, energy, and danceability*. (*Check the official definitions below.)
</p>

<p>
  The 'Valence vs Energy' tab helps you understand how a song's energy and mood relate. High valence and energy mean a happier vibe, while low energy and valence signal a sadder mood.
</p>

<h3>You Can Use It To:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Figure out a song's mood from a musical perspective.</li>
  <li>Discover connections between an artist's tracks based on their mood.</li>
  <li>Group tracks by mood.</li>
  <li>Create playlists with similar mood songs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The 'Danceability' tab visualizes how danceable songs are. You can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compare artists based on danceability.</li>
  <li>Find the most and least danceable songs.</li>
  <li>Create playlists based on this info.</li>
</ul>
